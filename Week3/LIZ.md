## Variables

Variables are very important in code. Variables hold a value that can be reused. That value can be changed throughout the course of your code.

## Strings

Strings hold a text of characters enclosed by quotation marks like "Hello! :)".

## Functions (arguments, `return`)

A Function is group of statements that together perform a specific task. The function returns a value by taking arguments.

Arguments are the values passed to that function to be invoked.

When return is used in a function, the function stops running and gives you the result of that function.

## `if` statements

An if statement is used to determine if a condition is true. An else statement is used to determine if a condition is false. 

## Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

A boolean is a data type that can be either true or false.
